## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-o** or **-e**.

* *Examples:* dobro (well, from dobry - good), brzo (quickly, from brzy - quick), tiho (quietly, from tihy - quiet), daleko (far).
* *In sentences:* On govori **dobro** (He speaks well). Ona běga **brzo** (She runs quickly). Živemo **daleko** (We live far away).
