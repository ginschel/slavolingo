## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past is done using the simple past tense. This is formed using a conjugated form of byti and the verb's past participle, which ends in **-l**. 
The ending of this '-l form' changes to match the gender and number of the subject. 


The form of to be can be omitted for the third person singular and plural.

    * Feminine Singular: -**la** (Ona čita**la**)
    * Neuter Singular: -**lo** (Ono čita**lo**)
    * All Plural: -**li** (Oni/One čita**li**)

* *Examples:* Včera jesm **rabotal** (masc.) (Yesterday i worked). Včera ona **rabotala** (fem.) (Yesterday she worked). My jesmo **viděli** film (We saw a film). Oni **pribyli** pozdno (They arrived late).
