## Two Main Verb Conjugations (Imperfective)

Imperfective verbs describe actions that are ongoing, repeated, or not completed. In the present tense, most imperfective verbs follow one of two main patterns for their endings, depending on the verb's stem.

* **Conjugation 1 (often -a- stem):** Includes verbs like **čitati** (to read), **dělati** (to do). 'Ja' ends in -m, 'ty' in -š, etc.
    * *Example: čitati* -> Ja čita**m** (I read/am reading), Ty čita**š** (You read/are reading), On/Ona/Ono čita (He/She/It reads/is reading), My čita**mo** (We read/are reading), Vy čita**te** (You read/are reading), Oni/One čita**jut** (They read/are reading).
* **Conjugation 2 (often -i-/-ě- stem):** Includes verbs like **govoriti** (to speak), **viděti** (to see). 'Ja' often ends in -im (with possible consonant changes), 'ty' in -iš, etc.
    * *Example: govoriti* -> Ja govori**m** (I speak/am speaking), Ty govori**š** (You speak/are speaking), On/Ona/Ono govori (He/She/It speaks/is speaking), My govori**mo** (We speak/are speaking), Vy govori**te** (You speak/are speaking), Oni/Ony govor**et** (They speak/are speaking).
