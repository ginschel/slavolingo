## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). 
The **Locative case** is used for location after prepositions like **na** (on) or **v** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change but let's keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masc Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like Nominative. (e.g., Vidim **dom** - I see a house, Vidim **selo** - I see a village)
    * *Feminine:* End in -**u** or -**ju**. (e.g., Vidim **ženu** - I see a woman, Vidim **zemju** - I see land)
* **Locative with 'na/v' (Singular):**
    * *Masc/Neuter:* Ends in **-u**. (e.g., na **stolu** - on a table, v **polju** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Often end in **-ě** or **-i**(soft ending). (e.g., na **rěkě** - on a river, na **zemji** - on land)
* *Examples:* Čitam **knigu** (I am reading a book). Sidim **na stolu** (We are sitting on a table).
