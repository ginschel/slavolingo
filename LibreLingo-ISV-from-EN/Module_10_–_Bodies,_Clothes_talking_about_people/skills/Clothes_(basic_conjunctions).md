## Using Conjunctions: 'i', 'ili', 'a'

Conjunctions are like glue words that connect words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **i:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Ja **i** ty - I and you. Čitam **i** pišu - I read and write.)
* **ili:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kava **ili** čaj? - Coffee or tea? Pridete **ili** ostanete doma? - Will you come or stay home?)
* **a:** Means "but" when showing contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., On jest učitelj, **a** ona jest studentka - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Ja idu, **a** ty ostaniješ - I am going, and you are staying.)
