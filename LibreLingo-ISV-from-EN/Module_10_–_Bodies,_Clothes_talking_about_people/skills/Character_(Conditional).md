## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the **-l form**) followed by the conjugated conditional particle **by**. 
The particle **by** often appears after the subject or the verb.

* *Formation:* Past tense (l-form) + conjugated form of **by**  (byh, bsy, by, byhmo, byste, by)

* *Examples:* Ja **čital byh** (m.) / **čitala byh** (f.) tu knigų (I would read that book). On **išel by** do kina (He would go to the cinema). My **dělali byhmo** to vsi zajedno (We would do that all together). čto **byste** **hotěli**? (What would you like? - using past tense plural for 'vy')
