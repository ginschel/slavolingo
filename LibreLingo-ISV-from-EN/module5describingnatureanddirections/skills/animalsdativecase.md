## The Dative Case: To Whom? For Whom?

The **Dative case** is used to show the indirect object of a verb – **to whom** or **for whom** an action is done. It's also used after certain verbs and prepositions (though we won't list all of them here). 
Its main purpose is to indicate the recipient of something or the beneficiary of an action.
