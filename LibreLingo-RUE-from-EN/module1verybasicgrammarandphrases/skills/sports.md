## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (кого or што receives the action). The **Locative case** is used for location after prepositions like **на** (on) or **в** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Виджу **град** - I see a city, Виджу **село** - I see a village)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-а). (e.g., Виджу **отця** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* End in **-у** / **-ю**. (e.g., Виджу **жену** - I see a woman, Виджу **книгу** - I see a book)
* **Locative with 'на/в' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-у** / **-і**. (e.g., на **столї** - on a table, в **селї** - in a village, на **поли** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Ends in **-і**. (e.g., на **рїцї** - on a river, в **землї** - in the earth)
* *Examples:* Читаю **книгу** (I am reading a book). Сидиме **на столї** (We are sitting on a table).
