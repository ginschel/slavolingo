## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the particle **бы** combined with the past active participle of the main verb (the **-в/-л/-ла/-ло/-ли** form). The particle **бы** typically follows the past participle or the first stressed word.

* Formation: Past active participle (-в/-л/-ла/-ло/-ли) + particle **бы**.

* *Examples:* Я **читав бы** (masc.) / **читала бы** (fem.) ту книгу (I would read that book). Вон **ишов бы** до кіна (He would go to the cinema). Мы **робили бы** то все вєдно (We would do that all together). Что **бы** вы **хотїли**? (What would you like?).
