## Using Conjunctions: 'і', 'а', 'або'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **і:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Я **і** ти - I and you. Читаю **і** пишу - I read and write.)
* **а:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Вон є учитель, **а** она є штудентка - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Я иду, **а** ти остаєш - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **або:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Кава **або** чай? - Coffee or tea? Прийдете **або** останете дома? - Will you come or stay home?)
