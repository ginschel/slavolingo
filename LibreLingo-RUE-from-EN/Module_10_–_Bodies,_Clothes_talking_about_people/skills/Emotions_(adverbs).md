## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-о** or **-е**.

* *Examples:* добре (well, from добрый - good), скоро (quickly, from скорый - quick), тихо (quietly, from тихий - quiet), далеко (far).
* *In sentences:* Вон говорит **добре** (He speaks well). Она біжыт **скоро** (She runs quickly). Жиєме **далеко** (We live far away).
