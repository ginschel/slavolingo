## The Instrumental Case: With and By Means Of

The **Instrumental case** primarily indicates *z kim* or *čim* an action is performed, or *čim*. It is always used with a preposition (most commonly **z/ze** - with) or after certain verbs, including the verb **być** (to be) when describing someone's profession or state. Upper Sorbian has singular, dual, and plural forms for the Instrumental case.
