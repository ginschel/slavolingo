## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-o** or **-e**.

* *Examples:* derje (well, from dobry - good), spěšnje (quickly, from spěšny - quick), ćicho (quietly, from ćichy - quiet), daloko (far).
* *In sentences:* Wón rěči **derje** (He speaks well). Wona běži **spěšnje** (She runs quickly). Bydlimy **daloko** (We live far away).
