## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the conditional forms of the verb **być** ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the **-ł/-ła/-ło/-li** form).

* Conditional forms of 'być': **bych, by, by, bymaj, bytaj, bytaj, bychmy, byće, bychu**
* Formation: Conditional 'być' form + Past active participle (-ł/-ła/-ło/-li)

* *Examples:* Ja **bych čitał** (masc.) / **bych čitała** (fem.) tu knih**u** (I would read that book). Wón **by šoł** do kina (He would go to the cinema). Mydwě **bymaj dźěłałoj** to wšo zhromadnje (We two would do that all together). Što **byšće** wy **chcěli**? (What would you like?).
