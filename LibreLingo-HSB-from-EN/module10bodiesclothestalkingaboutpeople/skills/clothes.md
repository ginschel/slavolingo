## Using Conjunctions: 'a', 'a a', 'abo'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **a:** Means "and" or "but," often showing a slight contrast or connection. (e.g., Ja **a** ty - I and you. Čitam **a** pisam - I read and write).
* **a a:** Means "and," connecting similar items in a list. (e.g., Ja, **a a** ty, **a a** wón - I, and you, and he).
* **abo:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kawa **abo** tej? - Coffee or tea? Budźeće **abo** wostanace doma? - Will you come or stay home?).
