## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-o**, **-e**, or **-ě**.

* *Examples:* dobře (well, from dobrý - good), rychle (quickly, from rychlý - quick), tiše (quietly, from tichý - quiet), daleko (far).
* *In sentences:* On mluví **dobře** (He speaks well). Ona běží **rychle** (She runs quickly). Žijeme **daleko** (We live far away).
