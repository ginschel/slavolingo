## Using Conjunctions: 'a', 'i', 'nebo'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **a:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., On je učitel, **a** ona je studentka - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Já jdu, **a** ty zůstáváš - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **i:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Já **i** ty - I and you. Čtu **i** píšu - I read and write.)
* **nebo:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Káva **nebo** čaj? - Coffee or tea? Přijdete **nebo** zůstanete doma? - Will you come or stay home?)
