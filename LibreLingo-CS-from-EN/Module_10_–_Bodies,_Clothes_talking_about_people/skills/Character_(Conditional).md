## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood (kondicionál). This is formed using the conditional forms of the verb **být** ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the **-l/-la/-lo/-li** form).

* Conditional forms of 'být': **bych, bys, by, bychom, byste, by**
* Formation: Conditional 'být' form + Past active participle (-l/-la/-lo/-li)

* *Examples:* Já **bych četl** (masc.) / **bych četla** (fem.) tu knihu (I would read that book). On **by šel** do kina (He would go to the cinema). My **bychom dělali** to všechno společně (We would do that all together). Co **byste chtěli**? (What would you like?).
