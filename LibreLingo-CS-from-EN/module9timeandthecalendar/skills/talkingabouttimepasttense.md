## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past uses the simple past tense (prétéritum). This is formed using the past active participle of the verb, which ends in **-l** (for masculine singular), **-la** (for feminine singular), **-lo** (for neuter singular), or **-li** (for plural of all genders). The ending of this form changes to match the gender and number of the subject. The corresponding past tense form of the verb **být** is used for all persons *except* the third person singular and plural, where it is optional but often omitted in colloquial speech.

* Subject Gender/Number determines ending:
    * Masculine Singular: -**l** (followed by appropriate form of *být*) - On čet**l** (He read)
    * Feminine Singular: -**la** (followed by appropriate form of *být*) - Ona čet**la** (She read)
    * Neuter Singular: -**lo** (followed by appropriate form of *být*) - Ono čet**lo** (It read)
    * Plural (all genders): -**li** (followed by appropriate form of *být*) - Oni/Ony/Ona čet**li** (They read)

* *Examples:* Včera **jsem pracoval** (masc.) (Yesterday I worked). Včera ona **pracovala** (fem.) (Yesterday she worked). My **jsme viděli** film (We saw a film). Oni **přijeli** pozdě (They arrived late).
