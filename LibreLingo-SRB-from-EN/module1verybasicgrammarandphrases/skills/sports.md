## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (кога or шта receives the action). The **Locative case** is used for location after prepositions like **на** (on) or **у** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Видим **град** - I see a city, Видим **село** - I see a village)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-а). (e.g., Видим **оца** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* End in **-у**. (e.g., Видим **жену** - I see a woman, Видим **књигу** - I see a book)
* **Locative with 'на/у' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-у**. (e.g., на **столу** - on a table, у **граду** - in a city, на **пољу** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Ends in **-и**. (e.g., на **реци** - on a river, у **земљи** - in the earth)
* *Examples:* Читам **књигу** (I am reading a book). Седимо **на столу** (We are sitting on a table).
