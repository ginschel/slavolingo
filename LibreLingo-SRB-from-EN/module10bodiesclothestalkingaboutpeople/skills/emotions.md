## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-о** or **-е**.

* *Examples:* добро (well, from добар - good), брзо (quickly, from брз - quick), тихо (quietly, from тих - quiet), далеко (far).
* *In sentences:* Он говори **добро** (He speaks well). Она трчи **брзо** (She runs quickly). Живимо **далеко** (We live far away).
