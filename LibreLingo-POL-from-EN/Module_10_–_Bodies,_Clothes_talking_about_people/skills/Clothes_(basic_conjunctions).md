## Using Conjunctions: 'i', 'lub', 'a'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **i:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Ja **i** ty - I and you. Czytam **i** piszę - I read and write.)
* **lub:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kawa **lub** herbata? - Coffee or tea? Przyjdziecie **lub** zostaniecie w domu? - Will you come or stay home?)
* **a:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., On jest nauczycielem, **a** ona jest studentką - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Ja idę, **a** ty zostajesz - I am going, and you are staying.)
