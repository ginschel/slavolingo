## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-o** or **-e**.

* *Examples:* dobrze (well, from dobry - good), szybko (quickly, from szybki - quick), cicho (quietly, from cichy - quiet), daleko (far).
* *In sentences:* On mówi **dobrze** (He speaks well). Ona biega **szybko** (She runs quickly). Żyjemy **daleko** (We live far away).
