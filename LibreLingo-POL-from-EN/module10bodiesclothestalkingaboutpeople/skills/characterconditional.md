## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the **-ł/-ła/-ło/-li/-ły** form) followed by the conjugated conditional particle **by**. The particle **by** often appears directly after the verb or the subject.

* *Formation:* Past tense (l-form) + conjugated form of **by** (bym, byś, by, byśmy, byście, by)

* *Examples:* Ja **czytałbym** (m.) / **czytałabym** (ż.) tę książkę (I would read that book). On **poszedłby** do kina (He would go to the cinema). My **zrobilibyśmy** to wszystko razem (We would do that all together). Co **chcielibyście**? (What would you like? - using the past tense plural form for 'wy').
