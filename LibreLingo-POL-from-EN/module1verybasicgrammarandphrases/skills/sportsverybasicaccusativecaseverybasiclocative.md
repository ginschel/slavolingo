## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's begin with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). The **Locative case** is used for location after prepositions like **na** (on) or **w** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Widzę **dom** - I see a house, Widzę **miasto** - I see a city)
    * *Feminine:* End in **-ę**. (e.g., Widzę **kobietę** - I see a woman, Widzę **książkę** - I see a book)
* **Locative with 'na/w' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-e** or **-u**. (e.g., na **stole** - on a table, w **mieście** - in a city, na **polu** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Often end in **-e** or **-i** (after a soft consonant). (e.g., na **rzece** - on a river, w **ziemi** - in the earth, w **szkole** - in a school)
* *Examples:* Czytam **książkę** (I am reading a book). Siedzimy **na stole** (We are sitting on a table).
