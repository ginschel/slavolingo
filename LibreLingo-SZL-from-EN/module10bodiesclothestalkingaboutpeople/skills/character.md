## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the **-ł/-ła/-ło/-li** form) followed by the conditional particle **by**. The particle **by** is usually placed after the verb or the subject.

* *Formation:* Past tense (l-form) + particle **by**

* *Examples:* Jo **czytoł by** (m.) / **czytoła by** (f.) ta ksiůnżka (I would read that book). Łon **poszoł by** do kina (He would go to the cinema). My **robili by** to wszyjsko razym (We would do that all together). Co **byście chciele**? (What would you like? - using the past tense plural form for 'wy').
