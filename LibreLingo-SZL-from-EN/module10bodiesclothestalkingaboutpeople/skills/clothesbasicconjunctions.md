## Using Conjunctions: 'i', 'a', 'abo'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **i:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Jo **i** ty - I and you. Czytóm **i** pisza - I read and write.)
* **a:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Łon je utytelem, **a** łona je študyntkům - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Jo ida, **a** ty zostajesz - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **abo:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kawa **abo** tukej? - Coffee or here? Przijedziecie **abo** zostaniecie doma? - Will you come or stay at home?)
