## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's begin with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). The **Locative case** (also called Miejscownik) is used for location after prepositions like **na** (on) or **we** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Widza **stół** - I see a table, Widza **pole** - I see a field)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Widza **ôjca** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* End in **-a** (hard) / **-io** (soft). (e.g., Widza **babã** - I see a woman, Widza **ziymiã** - I see land)
* **Locative (Miejscownik) with 'na/we' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-u**. (e.g., na **stole** - on a table, we **polu** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Often end in **-e** or **-i**. (e.g., na **rzyce** - on a river, na **ziymi** - on land)
* *Examples:* Czytóm **ksiůnżka** (I am reading a book - Accusative feminine ending). Siedzymy **na stole** (We are sitting on a table).
