## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). The **Locative case** (also called Prepositional) is used for location after prepositions like **на** (on) or **в** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Я вижу **стол** - I see a table, Я вижу **го́род** - I see a city)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-а). (e.g., Я вижу **отца́** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* End in **-у**. (e.g., Я вижу **же́нщину** - I see a woman, Я вижу **кни́гу** - I see a book)
* **Locative (Prepositional) with 'на/в' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-е**. (e.g., на **столе́** - on a table, в **го́роде** - in a city, на **по́ле** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Ends in **-е** or **-и** (after certain letters). (e.g., на **реке́** - on a river, в **земле́** - in the earth, в **шко́ле** - in a school)
* *Examples:* Я чита́ю **кни́гу** (I am reading a book). Мы сиди́м **на столе́** (We are sitting on a table).
