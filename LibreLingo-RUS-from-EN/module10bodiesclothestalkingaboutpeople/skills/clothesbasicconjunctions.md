## Using Conjunctions: 'и', 'а', 'или'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **и:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Я **и** ты - I and you. Я чита́ю **и** пишу́ - I read and write.)
* **а:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Он учи́тель, **а** она́ студе́нтка - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Я иду́, **а** ты остаёшься - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **или:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Ко́фе **или** чай? - Coffee or tea? Вы придёте **или** оста́нетесь до́ма? - Will you come or stay home?)
