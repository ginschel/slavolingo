## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the **-л/-ла/-ло/-ли** form) followed by the conditional particle **бы**. The particle **бы** is usually placed after the verb or the subject, but can also appear after other words for emphasis.

* *Formation:* Past tense (l-form) + particle **бы**

* *Examples:* Я **чита́л бы** (m.) / **чита́ла бы** (f.) ту кни́гу (I would read that book). Он **пошёл бы** в кино́ (He would go to the cinema). Мы **сде́лали бы** это всё вме́сте (We would do that all together). Что **бы вы хоте́ли**? (What would you like? - **бы** follows the question word).
