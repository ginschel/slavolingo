## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Ukrainian language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'Byti' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (**бути**) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. The forms for the present tense are:

* Я **є** (rarely used, usually omitted) / **Я єсмь** (archaic) / **Я єсьм** (archaic) (I am)
* Ти **є** (rarely used, usually omitted) / **Ти єси** (archaic) (You are, singular informal)
* Він/Вона/Воно **є** (rarely used, usually omitted) / **Він єсть** (archaic) (He/She/It is)
* Ми **є** (rarely used, usually omitted) / **Ми єсмо** (archaic) (We are)
* Ви **є** (rarely used, usually omitted) / **Ви єсте** (archaic) (You are, plural or singular formal)
* Вони **є** (rarely used, usually omitted) / **Вони суть** (archaic) (They are)

In modern Ukrainian, the present tense forms of "бути" are almost always omitted, especially with nouns and adjectives, except for emphasis. Instead, the noun or adjective simply follows the subject.

* *Examples:* Я студент (I am a student). Моя сестра добра (My sister is good). Ми добрі друзі (We are good friends). Вони тут (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Ukrainian nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

* **Masculine:** Most nouns ending in a hard consonant are masculine (e.g., **стіл** - table, **учитель** - teacher). Also, some nouns ending in a soft sign (-ь) are masculine (e.g., **день** - day).
* **Feminine:** Most nouns ending in -**а** or -**я** are feminine (e.g., **жінка** - woman, **книжка** - book, **земля** - earth/land). Also, some nouns ending in a soft sign (-ь) are feminine (e.g., **ніч** - night).
* **Neuter:** Most nouns ending in -**о**, -**е**, or -**я** (after a soft consonant or vowel) are neuter (e.g., **вікно** - window, **поле** - field, **море** - sea).

* *Keep in mind:* There are some exceptions to these rules, especially with nouns ending in -ь, where gender needs to be memorized.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The **Nominative case** is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

* **Nouns:** Singular forms follow the gender rules described above. Plural nouns often end in -**и**, -**і**, or -**а**/-**я**.
    * *Examples:* Singular: **стіл** (m), **жінка** (f), **вікно** (n). Plural: **столи́**, **жі́нки**, **ві́кна**.
* **Adjectives:** Agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    * *Hard Stem Examples:* Singular: **добрий** (m), **добра** (f), **добре** (n). Plural: **добрі** (all genders).
    * *Soft Stem Examples:* Singular: **синій** (m), **синя** (f), **синє** (n). Plural: **сині** (all genders).
* *Examples:* **Добрий дім** старий (A good house is old). **Зелені поля** зелені (Green fields are green). **Красиві жінки** говорять (Beautiful women are speaking). **Сині очі** красиві (Blue eyes are beautiful).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they must agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to. Using them helps to clarify exactly which item you mean from a group.

* **Singular:** **цей** (m), **ця** (f), **це** (n) - (this/that)
* **Plural:** **ці** (all genders) - (these/those)

* *Examples:* **Цей** дім великий (This/That house is big). **Ця** книжка моя (This/That book is mine). **Це** наше місто (This/That is our city). **Ці** люди веселі (These/Those people are cheerful).
