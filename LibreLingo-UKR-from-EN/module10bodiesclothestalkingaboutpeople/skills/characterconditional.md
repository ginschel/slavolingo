## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the **-в/-л/-ла/-ло/-ли** form) followed by the conditional particle **би**. The particle **би** is usually placed after the verb or the subject, but can also appear after other words for emphasis.

* *Formation:* Past tense (l-form) + particle **би**

* *Examples:* Я **чита́в би** (m.) / **чита́ла би** (f.) ту кни́жку (I would read that book). Він **пішо́в би** в кін**о́** (He would go to the cinema). Ми **зроби́ли б** це все ра́зом (We would do that all together - **би** can shorten to **б** after a vowel). Що **б ви хотíли**? (What would you like? - **би** after a vowel).
