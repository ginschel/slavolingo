## Using Conjunctions: 'і', 'а', 'чи', 'або'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Some essential ones are:

* **і/й:** Means "and," connecting similar things. Use **й** after a vowel, **і** after a consonant or at the beginning of a sentence. (e.g., Я **і** ти - I and you. Чита́ю **й** пишу́ - I read and write.)
* **а:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Він учи́тель, **а** вона́ студе́нтка - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Я йду, **а** ти залиша́єшся - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **чи:** Means "or" when offering a choice or asking a question. (e.g., Ка́ва **чи** чай? - Coffee or tea? Ти йдеш **чи** залиша́єшся?)
* **або:** Also means "or," generally when presenting distinct alternatives. (e.g., Прийдіть сьо́годні **або** за́втра - Come today or tomorrow.)
