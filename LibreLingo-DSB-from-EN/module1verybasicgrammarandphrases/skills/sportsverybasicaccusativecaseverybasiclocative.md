## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). The **Locative case** (also called Prepositional) is used for location after prepositions like **na** (on) or **w** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Ja wiźim **stoł** - I see a table, Ja wiźim **město** - I see a city)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Ja wiźim **nanśa** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* End in **-u** (hard) / **-u** (soft). (e.g., Ja wiźim **žonu** - I see a woman, Ja wiźim **knigłu** - I see a book)
* **Locative (Prepositional) with 'na/w' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-u**. (e.g., na **stol**u - on a table, w **měsć**e - in a city, na **pól**u - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Ends in **-e**. (e.g., na **rěk**e - on a river, w **zemj**i - in the earth, w **škol**e - in a school)
* *Examples:* Ja cytam **knigłu** (I am reading a book). Smy seźimy **na stolu** (We are sitting on a table).
