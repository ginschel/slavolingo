## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the **-ł/-ła/-ło/-li** form) followed by the conditional particle **by**. The particle **by** is usually placed after the verb or the subject.

* *Formation:* Past tense (l-form) + particle **by**

* *Examples:* Ja **cytał by** (m.) / **cytała by** (f.) tu knigłu (I would read that book). Wón **šoł by** do kina (He would go to the cinema). My **zrobili by** to wšykno gromaźe (We would do that all together). Co **by wy kśěli**? (What would you like? - using the past tense plural form for 'wy').
