## Easy Comparisons: Wušej and Njež

To make simple comparisons meaning 'more than', you often use a comparative adjective (like 'better', 'bigger') followed by the word **njež** (than). The word **wušej** is the comparative form of wusoki (tall/high) and means 'higher' or 'taller'.

* *Using njež:* Moja knigła jo zajmowjejša, **njež** twója (My book is more interesting than yours). Wón jo staršy, **njež** ja (He is older than me).
* *Using wušej:* Ta góra jo **wušej**, njež ten bugel (That mountain is higher than that hill). Wón skóći **wušej** ako norma (He jumped higher than the norm).
