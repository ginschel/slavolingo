## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-o** or **-e**.

* *Examples:* derje (well, from dobry - good), malsnje (quickly, from malsny - quick), śicho (quietly, from śichy - quiet), daloko (far).
* *In sentences:* Wón powěda **derje** (He speaks well). Wóna běža **malsnje** (She runs quickly). My bydlime **daloko** (We live far away).
