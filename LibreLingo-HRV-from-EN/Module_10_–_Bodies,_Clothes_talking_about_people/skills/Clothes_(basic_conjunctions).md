## Using Conjunctions: 'i', 'a', 'ili'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **i:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Ja **i** ti - I and you. Čitam **i** pišem - I read and write.)
* **a:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., On je učitelj, **a** ona je studentica - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Ja idem, **a** ti ostaješ - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **ili:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kava **ili** čaj? - Coffee or tea? Hoćete li doći **ili** ostati kod kuće? - Will you come or stay at home?)
