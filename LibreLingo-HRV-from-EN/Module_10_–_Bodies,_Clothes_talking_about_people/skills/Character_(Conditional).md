## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood (kondicional I). This is formed using the conditional forms of the verb **biti** ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the **-o/-la/-lo/-li** form).

* Conditional forms of 'biti': **bih, bi, bi, bismo, biste, bi**
* Formation: Conditional 'biti' form + Past active participle (-o/-la/-lo/-li)

* *Examples:* Ja **bih čitao** (m.) / **bih čitala** (f.) tu knjigu (I would read that book). On **bi išao** u kino (He would go to the cinema). Mi **bismo radili** to sve zajedno (We would do that all together). Što **biste htjeli**? (What would you like?).
