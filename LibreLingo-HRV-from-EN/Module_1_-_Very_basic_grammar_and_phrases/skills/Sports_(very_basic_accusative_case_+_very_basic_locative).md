## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). The **Locative case** (also called Prepositional) is used for location after prepositions like **na** (on) or **u** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Vidim **stol** - I see a table, Vidim **selo** - I see a village)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Vidim **oca** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* End in **-u**. (e.g., Vidim **ženu** - I see a woman, Vidim **knjigu** - I see a book)
* **Locative (Prepositional) with 'na/u' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-u**. (e.g., na **stolu** - on a table, u **gradu** - in a city, na **polju** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Ends in **-i**. (e.g., na **reci** - on a river, u **zemlji** - in the earth, u **školi** - in a school)
* *Examples:* Čitam **knjigu** (I am reading a book). Sjedimo **na stolu** (We are sitting on a table).
