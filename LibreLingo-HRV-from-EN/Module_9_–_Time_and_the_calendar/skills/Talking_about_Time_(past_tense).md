## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past uses the simple past tense (perfekt). This is formed using the present tense forms of the verb **biti** ('to be') and the past active participle of the main verb, which ends in **-o** (masculine singular), **-la** (feminine singular), **-lo** (neuter singular), or **-li** (plural).

* Formation: Present tense of 'biti' + Past active participle (-o/-la/-lo/-li)

* *Examples:* Jučer **sam radio** (masc.) (Yesterday I worked). Jučer **je radila** (fem.) (Yesterday she worked). Mi **smo vidjeli** film (We saw a film). Oni **su stigli** kasno (They arrived late).
