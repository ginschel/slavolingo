## Easy Comparisons: Više and Nego/Od

To make simple comparisons meaning 'more than', you often use a comparative adjective (like 'bolji' - better, 'veći' - bigger) followed by the word **nego** or **od** (than). The word **više** generally means 'more' or 'a greater amount' and can be used with nouns in the genitive case or as a comparative adverb. It's also the comparative form of 'visok' (tall/high) in some contexts, but 'viši' is the standard comparative adjective form.

* *Using nego:* Moja knjiga je zanimljivija **nego** tvoja (My book is more interesting than yours). On je stariji **nego** ja (He is older than me).
* *Using od:* Moja knjiga je zanimljivija **od** tvoje (My book is more interesting than yours). On je stariji **od** mene (He is older than me).
* *Using viši/više:* Ta planina je **viša** nego ono brdo (That mountain is higher than that hill). On je skočio **više** od norme (He jumped more than the norm).
