## The ordinal numbers from 1 to 1000 are these:
* 1 prvi
* 2 drugi
* 3 treći
* 4 četvrti
* 5 peti
* 6 šesti
* 7 sedmi
* 8 osmi
* 9 deveti
* 100 stoti
* 1000 tisućiti

Like in the Interslavic explanation, these function grammatically like adjectives and decline accordingly.

To state the time of day, you typically use the preposition **u** followed by the ordinal number in the Locative case and the word **sati** (Locative case of "sat" - hour).

* *Example:* 8:45 -> u osm**i** sati četrdeset pet minuta - at eight forty-five.
