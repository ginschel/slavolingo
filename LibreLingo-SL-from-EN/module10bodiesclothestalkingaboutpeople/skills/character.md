## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the conditional forms of the verb **biti** ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the **-l/-la/-lo/-li** form).

* Conditional forms of 'biti': **bi** (for all persons and numbers)
* Formation: Conditional 'bi' + Past active participle (-l/-la/-lo/-li)

* *Examples:* Jaz **bi bral** (masc.) / **bi brala** (fem.) to knjigo (I would read that book). On **bi Å¡el** v kino (He would go to the cinema). Midva **bi delala** to vse skupaj (We two would do that all together). Kaj **bi** vi **hoteli**? (What would you like?).
