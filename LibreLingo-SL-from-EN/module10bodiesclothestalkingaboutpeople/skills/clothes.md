## Using Conjunctions: 'in', 'ali', 'pa'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **in:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Jaz **in** ti - I and you. Berem **in** pišem - I read and write.)
* **ali:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kava **ali** čaj? - Coffee or tea? Boste prišli **ali** ostali doma? - Will you come or stay home?)
* **pa:** Can mean "and" or "but," often adding a slight emphasis or contrast. (e.g., On je učitelj, **pa** ona je študentka - He is a teacher, and she is a student / He is a teacher, but she is a student. Jaz grem, **pa** ti ostaneš - I am going, and you are staying.)
