## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (koga or kaj receives the action). The **Locative case** is used for location after prepositions like **na** (on) or **v** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change but let's keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Vidim **grad** - I see a castle, Vidim **mesto** - I see a city)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Vidim **očeta** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* Ending **-o**. (e.g., Vidim **žensko** - I see a woman, Vidim **knjigo** - I see a book)
* **Locative with 'na/v' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-u**. (e.g., na **stolu** - on a table, v **mestu** - in a city, na **polju** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Ends in **-i**. (e.g., na **reki** - on a river, v **zemlji** - in the earth)
* *Examples:* Berem **knjigo** (I am reading a book). Sedim **na stolu** (I am sitting on a table).
