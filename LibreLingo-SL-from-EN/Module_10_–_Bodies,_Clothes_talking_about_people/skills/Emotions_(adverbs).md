## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-o**.

* *Examples:* dobro (well, from dober - good), hitro (quickly, from hiter - quick), tiho (quietly, from tih - quiet), daleč (far).
* *In sentences:* On govori **dobro** (He speaks well). Ona teče **hitro** (She runs quickly). Živimo **daleč** (We live far away).
