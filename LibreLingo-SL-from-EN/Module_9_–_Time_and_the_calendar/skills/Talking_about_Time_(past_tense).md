## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past uses the simple past tense. This is formed using the past active participle of the verb, which ends in **-l** (for masculine singular), **-la** (for feminine singular), **-lo** (for neuter singular), **-la** (for dual masculine), **-li** (for dual feminine/neuter), or **-li** (for plural of all genders). The ending of this form changes to match the gender and number of the subject. The corresponding present tense form of the verb **biti** is used for all persons *except* the third person singular and plural, where it is often omitted.

* Subject Gender/Number determines ending:
    * Masculine Singular: -**l** (followed by appropriate form of *biti*) - On bral (He read)
    * Feminine Singular: -**la** (followed by appropriate form of *biti*) - Ona bra**la** (She read)
    * Neuter Singular: -**lo** (followed by appropriate form of *biti*) - Ono bra**lo** (It read)

    * Plural (all genders): -**li** (followed by appropriate form of *biti*) - Mi bra**li**, Oni bra**li** (We read, They read)
