## The Future Tense

To express actions that will happen in the future using imperfective verbs, you typically form it by combining the future tense of the verb **biti** ('to be') with the past active participle of the main verb. For perfective verbs, you use the simple future tense form (one word).

* Compound Future ('biti' + Past Active Participle - for imperfective verbs): bom, boš, bo, bova/bosta/bosta, bomo, boste, bodo + Past active participle (-l/-la/-lo/-li)
* Simple Future (for perfective verbs): Formed using the present tense stem of the perfective verb.

* *Examples (Compound Future - imperfective):* Jaz **bom bral** knjigo (I will read a book). Ti **boš govoril** z njim (You will talk with him). Ona **bo delala** jutri (She will work tomorrow). Midva **bova pisala** (We two will write). Oni **bodo gledali** film (They will watch a film).
* *Examples (Simple Future - perfective):* Jaz **preberem** knjigo (I will read a book). Ti **poveš** mu (You will tell him). Ona **naredi** to (She will do it).
