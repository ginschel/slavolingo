## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). The **Locative case** (also called Prepositional) is used for location after prepositions like **на** (on) or **у/ў** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Я ба́чу **стол** - I see a table, Я ба́чу **го́рад** - I see a city)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-а). (e.g., Я ба́чу **ба́цьку** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* End in **-у**. (e.g., Я ба́чу **жанчы́ну** - I see a woman, Я ба́чу **кнíгу** - I see a book)
* **Locative (Prepositional) with 'на/у/ў' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-е** or **-у**. (e.g., на **стале́** - on a table, у **го́радзе** - in a city, на **по́лі** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Ends in **-е** or **-і** (after certain consonants). (e.g., на **рац**э́** - on a river, у **зямл**í** - in the earth, у **шко́л**е** - in a school)
* *Examples:* Я чыта́ю **кнíгу** (I am reading a book). Мы сідзі́м **на стале́** (We are sitting on a table).
