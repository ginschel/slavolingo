## Using Conjunctions: 'і', 'а', 'цi', 'або'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Some essential ones are:

* **і/і́:** Means "and," connecting similar things. Use **і́** at the beginning of a sentence or after a vowel for emphasis, **і** after a consonant. (e.g., Я **і** ты - I and you. Чыта́ю **і́** пішу́ - I read and write.)
* **а:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Ён настаўнік, **а** яна́ студэ́нтка - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Я іду́, **а** ты застае́шся - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **цi:** Means "or" when offering a choice or asking a question. (e.g., Ка́ва **цi** чай? - Coffee or tea? Ты ідзе́ш **цi** застае́шся?)
* **або:** Also means "or," generally when presenting distinct alternatives. (e.g., Прыйдзі́це сёння **або** за́ўтра - Come today or tomorrow.)
