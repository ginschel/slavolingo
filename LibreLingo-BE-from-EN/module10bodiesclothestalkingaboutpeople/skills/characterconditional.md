## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the **-ў/-л/-ла/-ло/-лі** form) followed by the conditional particle **бы**. The particle **бы** is usually placed after the verb or the subject, but can also appear after other words for emphasis.

* *Formation:* Past tense (l-form) + particle **бы**

* *Examples:* Я **чыта́ў бы** (m.) / **чыта́ла бы** (f.) тую́ кнíгу (I would read that book). Ён **пайшо́ў бы** ў кін**о́** (He would go to the cinema). Мы **зрабі́лі б** гэта ўсё ра́зам (We would do that all together - **бы** can shorten to **б** after a vowel). Што **б вы хаце́лі**? (What would you like? - **бы** after a vowel).
