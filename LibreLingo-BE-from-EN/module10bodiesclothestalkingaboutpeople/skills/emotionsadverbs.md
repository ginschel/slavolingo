## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-а** or **-о**.

* *Examples:* до́бра (well, from до́бры - good), ху́тка (quickly, from ху́ткі - quick), цíха (quietly, from цíхі - quiet), дале́ка (far).
* *In sentences:* Ён гаво́рыць **до́бра** (He speaks well). Яна́ бе́гае **ху́тка** (She runs quickly). Мы жыве́м **дале́ка** (We live far away).
