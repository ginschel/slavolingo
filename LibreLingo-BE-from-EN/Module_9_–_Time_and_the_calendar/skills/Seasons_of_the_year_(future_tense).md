## The Future Tense

To express actions that will happen in the future using imperfective verbs, you typically form it by combining a future form of the verb **быць** ('to be') with the infinitive (the base form, ending in **-ць**) of the main verb. Alternatively, for many verbs, you can use a synthetic future tense form (one word).

* Compound Future ('Быць' + Infinitive): буду, будзеш, будзе, будзем, будзеце, будуць + Infinitive
* Synthetic Future (for many verbs): often formed by adding prefixes to the infinitive or present tense stem.

* *Examples (Compound Future):* Я **бу́ду чыта́ць** кнíгу (I will read a book). Ты **бу́дзеш гавары́ць** з ім (You will talk with him). Яна́ **бу́дзе працава́ць** за́ўтра (She will work tomorrow). Мы **бу́дзем піса́ць** (We will write). Яны́ **бу́дуць глядзе́ць** фільм (They will watch a film).
* *Examples (Synthetic Future):* Я **прачыта́ю** кнíгу (I will read a book). Ты **ска́жаш** яму́ (You will tell him). Яна́ **зро́біць** гэта (She will do it).
