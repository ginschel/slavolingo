## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the aorist forms of the verb **бы́ти** ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the **-лъ/-ла/-ло/-ли** form).

* Aorist forms of 'бы́ти': **бꙑ́хъ, бꙑ́, бꙑ́, бꙑ́ховѣ, бꙑ́ста, бꙑ́стѣ, бꙑ́хомъ, бꙑ́сте, бꙑ́шѧ**
* Formation: Aorist of 'бы́ти' + Past active participle (-лъ/-ла/-ло/-ли)

* *Examples:* А́зъ **бꙑ́хъ чи́талъ** (masc.) / **бꙑ́хъ чи́тала** (fem.) тꙋ̀ кни́гꙋ (I would read that book). То́й **бꙑ́ є҆ді́нъ шє́лъ** въ кино̀ (He would go to the cinema alone). Мꙑ̀ **бꙑ́хомъ сътвори́ли** сіѐ всѐ вьсе́ю (We would do all this together). Что̀ **бꙑ́сте хотѣ́ли**? (What would you like?).
