## Using Conjunctions: 'и҆', 'а', 'и҆лѝ'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **и҆/ѝ:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. Use **ѝ** before a vowel, **и҆** before a consonant. (e.g., А́зъ **и҆** тꙑ̀ - I and you. Чита́ю **ѝ** пишꙋ̀ - I read and write.)
* **а:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., То́й є҆́сть оучи́тель, **а** та̀ є҆́сть оучени́ца - He is a teacher, but she is a student. А́зъ идꙋ̀, **а** тꙑ̀ о҆стае́ши сѧ - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **и҆лѝ:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Ка́ва **и҆лѝ** ча́й? - Coffee or tea? Придѣ́те **и҆лѝ** о҆ста́нете сѧ до́ма? - Will you come or stay at home?)
