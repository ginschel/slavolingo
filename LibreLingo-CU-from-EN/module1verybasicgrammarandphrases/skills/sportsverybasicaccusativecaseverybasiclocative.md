## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (кого or что receives the action). The **Locative case** (also called Prepositional) is used for location after prepositions like **на** (on) or **въ** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change but let's keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Ви́ждꙋ **до́мъ** - I see a house, Ви́ждꙋ **село̀** - I see a village)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-а). (e.g., Ви́ждꙋ **о҆тца̀** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* hard **-ꙋ́**, soft **-ю̀**. (e.g., Ви́ждꙋ **женꙋ̀** - I see a woman, Ви́ждꙋ **зе́млю** - I see land)
* **Locative (Prepositional) with 'на/въ' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* hard **-ѣ́**, soft **-и** or **-и**. (e.g., на **столѣ̀** - on a table, въ **селѣ̀** - in a village, на по́л**и** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* hard **-ѣ́**, soft **-и**. (e.g., на рѣц**ѣ̀** - on a river, въ земл**ѝ** - in the earth)
* *Examples:* Чита́ѭ **кни́гꙋ** (I am reading a book). Сѣди́мъ **на столѣ̀** (We are sitting on a table).
