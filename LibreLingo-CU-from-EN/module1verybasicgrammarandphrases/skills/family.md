## The Instrumental Case: With and By Means Of

The **Instrumental case** primarily indicates *съ кѣмъ* or *чи́мъ* an action is performed, or *чи́мъ*. It is always used with a preposition (most commonly **съ** - with) or after certain verbs, including the verb **бы́ти** (to be) when describing someone's profession or state. Church Slavonic has singular, dual, and plural forms for the Instrumental case.
