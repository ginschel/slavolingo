## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (kògò or co receives the action). The **Locative case** is used for location after prepositions like **na** (on) or **w** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Widzã **dom** - I see a house, Widzã **sélko** - I see a small village)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Widzã **òjca** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* End in **-ã** or **-ą**. (e.g., Widzã ** białkã** - I see a woman, Widzã **knégã** - I see a book)
* **Locative with 'na/w' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-u**. (e.g., na **stolu** - on a table, w **sélku** - in a small village)
    * *Feminine:* Often end in **-e** or **-i**. (e.g., na **rece** - on a river, na **zemi** - on land)
* *Examples:* Czëtóm **knégã** (I am reading a book - Accusative feminine ending). Sedzëma **na stolu** (We are sitting on a table).
