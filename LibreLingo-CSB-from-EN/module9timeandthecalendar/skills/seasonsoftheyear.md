## The Future Tense

To express actions that will happen in the future using imperfective verbs, you typically form it by combining the future tense of the verb **bëc** ('to be') with the infinitive of the main verb, or using the simple future for perfective verbs.

* Compound Future ('bëc' + Infinitive - for imperfective verbs): bùdã, bùdzesz, bùdze, bùdzemë, bùdzece, bùdą + Infinitive.
* Simple Future (for perfective verbs): Formed using the present tense conjugation of the perfective verb.

* *Examples (Compound Future - imperfective):* Jô **bùdã czëtac** knégã (I will read a book). Të **bùdzesz gôdac** z nim (You will talk with him). Òna **bùdze robic** jutrã (She will work tomorrow). Më **bùdzemë pisac** (We will write). Òni **bùdą kùkac** na film (They will watch a film).
* *Examples (Simple Future - perfective):* Jô **przeczëtóm** knégã (I will read a book). Të **pòwiesz** mù (You will tell him). Òna **zrobi** to (She will do it).
