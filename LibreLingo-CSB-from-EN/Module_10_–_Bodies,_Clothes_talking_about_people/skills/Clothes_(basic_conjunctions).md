## Using Conjunctions: 'ë', 'a', 'abò'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **ë:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Jô **ë** të - I and you. Czëtóm **ë** piszę - I read and write.)
* **a:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Òn je ùczëcel, **a** òna je sztudéntka - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Jô jidã, **a** të òstajesz - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **abò:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kawa **abò** téj? - Coffee or tea? Przëńdzece **abò** òstanace doma? - Will you come or stay at home?)
