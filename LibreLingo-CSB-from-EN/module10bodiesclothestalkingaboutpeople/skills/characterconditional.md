## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the particle **bë** (or **bëch**, **bës**, **bë**, etc., depending on dialect and person) combined with the past participle of the main verb (the **-ł/-ła/-ło/-lë** form).

* Formation: Conditional particle ('bë' or conjugated form) + Past participle (-ł/-ła/-ło/-lë)

* *Examples:* Jô **bëczëtôł** (masc.) / **bë czëtôła** (fem.) tą knégã (I would read that book). Òn **bë szedł** do kina (He would go to the cinema). Më **bë robilë** to wszëtkò razã (We would do that all together). Czë to **bë wë chcële**? (What would you like?).
