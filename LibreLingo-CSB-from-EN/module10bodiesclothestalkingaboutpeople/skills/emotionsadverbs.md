## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-o** or **-e**.

* *Examples:* dobrze (well, from dobri - good), chùtczi (quickly, from chùtczi - quick), cëchò (quietly, from cëchi - quiet), dalekò (far).
* *In sentences:* Òn gôdô **dobrze** (He speaks well). Òna biégô **chùtczi** (She runs quickly). Mieszkómë **dalekò** (We live far away).
