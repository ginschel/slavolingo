## The Simple Past Tense (Aorist and Imperfect)

Old Church Slavonic has several past tenses, including the Aorist and the Imperfect. These describe completed actions (Aorist) or ongoing/repeated actions (Imperfect) in the past.

* **Aorist:** Formed by adding specific endings directly to the verb stem. Endings vary based on verb class and person/number (singular, dual, plural).
    * *Example: пасти́ (to fall)* -> Sg: Азъ па́схъ, Тꙑ па́се, Онъ па́се. Du: Вѣ па́совѣ, Въі па́ста, Онѣ па́стѣ. Pl: Мꙑ па́сомъ, Вꙑ па́сте, Они́ па́сѫ.
* **Imperfect:** Formed by adding specific endings to the verb stem, often including -ѣа- or -аа-. Endings vary based on verb class and person/number.
    * *Example: нес**ѣа**хъ (I was carrying)* -> Sg: Азъ нес**ѣа**хъ, Тꙑ нес**ѣа**ше, Онъ нес**ѣа**ше. Du: Вѣ нес**ѣа**ховѣ, Въі нес**ѣа**шета, Онѣ нес**ѣа**шетѣ. Pl: Мꙑ нес**ѣа**хомъ, Вꙑ нес**ѣа**шете, Они́ нес**ѣа**хѫ.
