## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (кого or что receives the action). The **Locative case** (also called Prepositional) is used for location after prepositions like **на** (on) or **въ** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change but let's keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Вижджѫ̀ **домъ** - I see a house, Вижджѫ̀ **село́** - I see a village)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Вижджѫ̀ **отьцꙗ́** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* hard **-ѫ**, soft **-ѭ**. (e.g., Вижджѫ̀ **женѫ́** - I see a woman, Вижджѫ̀ **землю́** - I see land)
* **Locative (Prepositional) with 'на/въ' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* hard **-ѣ**, soft **-и** or **-и**. (e.g., на **столѣ́** - on a table, въ **селѣ́** - in a village, на **поли** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* hard **-ѣ**, soft **-и**. (e.g., на **рѣцѣ́** - on a river, въ **земли́** - in the earth)
* *Examples:* Чи́тамъ **книгѫ́** (I am reading a book). Сѣди́мъ **на столѣ́** (We are sitting on a table).
