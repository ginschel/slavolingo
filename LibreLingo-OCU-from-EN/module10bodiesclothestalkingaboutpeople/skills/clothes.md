## Using Conjunctions: 'и', 'а', 'или'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **и:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Азъ **и** тꙑ - I and you. Чи́тамъ **и** пишѫ́ - I read and write.)
* **а:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Онъ ѥстъ оучи́тель, **а** она́ ѥстъ оучени́ца - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Азъ идѫ́, **а** тꙑ оста́ѥши сѧ - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **или:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Ка́ва **или** ча́и? - Coffee or tea? Придѣ́те **или** оста́нете сѧ дома́? - Will you come or stay at home?)
