## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the aorist forms of the verb **быти** ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the **-лъ/-ла/-ло/-ли** form).

* Aorist forms of 'быти': **бы́хъ, бы́, бы́, бы́ховѣ, бы́ста, бы́стѣ, бы́хомъ, бы́сте, бы́шѧ**
* Formation: Aorist of 'быти' + Past active participle (-лъ/-ла/-ло/-ли)

* *Examples:* Азъ **бы́хъ чи́талъ** (masc.) / **бы́хъ чи́тала** (fem.) тоу книгѫ́ (I would read that book). Онъ **бы́ ѥдинъ шьлъ** въ кино́ (He would go to the cinema alone). Мꙑ **бы́хомъ сътвори́ли** сиѥ все вьсе́ѭ (We would do all this together). Чьто́ **бы́сте хотѣ́ли**? (What would you like?).
