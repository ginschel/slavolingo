## Easy Comparisons: Въіше and Nеже/Отъ

To make simple comparisons meaning 'more than' or 'taller/higher than', you often use a comparative adjective (like 'лѣ́пшии' - better, 'бо́лии' - bigger) followed by the word **неже** or **отъ** (than). The word **въіше** is the comparative adverb of высо́къ (tall/high) and means 'higher' or 'taller'.

* *Using неже:* Моꙗ́ книга ѥстъ ціка́вѣиши **неже** твоꙗ́ (My book is more interesting than yours). Онъ ѥстъ ста́рѣиши **неже** азъ (He is older than me).
* *Using отъ:* Моꙗ́ книга ѥстъ ціка́вѣиши **отъ** твоѥѩ́ (My book is more interesting than yours). Онъ ѥстъ ста́рѣиши **отъ** мене́ (He is older than me).
* *Using въіше:* Та гора́ ѥстъ **въіше**, неже тъ хълмъ (That mountain is higher than that hill). Онъ скочи́ **въіше** за но́рмѫ (He jumped higher than the norm).
