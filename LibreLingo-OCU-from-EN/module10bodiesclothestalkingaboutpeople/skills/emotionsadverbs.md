## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-о** or **-е**.

* *Examples:* до́брѣ (well, from добръ - good), бы́стро (quickly, from бы́стръ - quick), ти́хо (quietly, from ти́хъ - quiet), дале́че (far).
* *In sentences:* Онъ гово́ритъ **до́брѣ** (He speaks well). Она́ бѣ́гаѥтъ **бы́стро** (She runs quickly). Живе́мъ **дале́че** (We live far away).
