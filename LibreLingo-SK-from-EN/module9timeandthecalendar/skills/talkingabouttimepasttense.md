## The Simple Past Tense (minulý čas)

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past uses the simple past tense (minulý čas). This is formed using the past active participle of the verb, which ends in **-l** (for masculine singular), **-la** (for feminine singular), **-lo** (for neuter singular), or **-li** (for plural of all genders). The ending of this form changes to match the gender and number of the subject. The corresponding past tense form of the verb **byť** is used for all persons *except* the third person singular and plural, where it is optional but often used for emphasis.

* Subject Gender/Number determines ending:
    * Masculine Singular: -**l** (followed by appropriate form of *byť*) - On číta**l** (He read)
    * Feminine Singular: -**la** (followed by appropriate form of *byť*) - Ona číta**la** (She read)
    * Neuter Singular: -**lo** (followed by appropriate form of *byť*) - Ono číta**lo** (It read)
    * Plural (all genders): -**li** (followed by appropriate form of *byť*) - Oni/Ony číta**li** (They read)

* *Examples:* Včera **som pracoval** (masc.) (Yesterday I worked). Včera ona **pracovala** (fem.) (Yesterday she worked). My **sme videli** film (We saw a film). Oni **prišli** neskoro (They arrived late).
