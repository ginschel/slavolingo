## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood (podmieňovací spôsob). This is formed using the conditional forms of the verb **byť** ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the **-l/-la/-lo/-li** form).

* Conditional forms of 'byť': **by som, by si, by, by sme, by ste, by**
* Formation: Conditional 'byť' form + Past active participle (-l/-la/-lo/-li)

* *Examples:* Ja **by som čítal** (masc.) / **by som čítala** (fem.) tú knihu (I would read that book). On **by šiel** do kina (He would go to the cinema). My **by sme robili** to všetko spolu (We would do that all together). Čo **by ste chceli**? (What would you like?).
