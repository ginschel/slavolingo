## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-o**, **-e**, or **-y**.

* *Examples:* dobre (well, from dobrý - good), rýchlo (quickly, from rýchly - quick), ticho (quietly, from tichý - quiet), ďaleko (far).
* *In sentences:* On hovorí **dobre** (He speaks well). Ona beží **rýchlo** (She runs quickly). Žijeme **ďaleko** (We live far away).
