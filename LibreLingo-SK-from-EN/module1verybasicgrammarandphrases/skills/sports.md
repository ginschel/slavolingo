## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (koho or čo receives the action). The **Locative case** is used for location after prepositions like **na** (on) or **v** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Vidím **hrad** - I see a castle, Vidím **mesto** - I see a city)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Vidím **otca** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* End in **-u**. (e.g., Vidím **ženu** - I see a woman, Vidím **knihu** - I see a book)
* **Locative with 'na/v' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-e** or **-u**. (e.g., na **stole** - on a table, v **meste** - in a city, na **poli** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Ends in **-e** or **-i**. (e.g., na **rieke** - on a river, v **zemi** - in the earth)
* *Examples:* Čítam **knihu** (I am reading a book). Sedíme **na stole** (We are sitting on a table).
